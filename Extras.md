# Glossary
1. **Machine Learning**: A field of computer science that focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: A type of machine learning that identifies patterns in data without using labeled responses.
3. **Supervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning the output is known and used to guide the learning process.
4. **Classification**: A supervised learning task where the goal is to assign input data to predefined categories.
5. **Regression**: A supervised learning task where the goal is to predict a continuous output variable based on input features.
6. **Feature Variable**: An input variable used in making predictions in a machine learning model.
7. **Target Variable**: The output variable that a model aims to predict.
8. **Split Data**: The process of dividing a dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model.
9. **Training/Fitting Data**: The data used to train a machine learning model to learn patterns and make predictions.
10. **K-Nearest Neighbors**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies new data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors.
11. **Accuracy**: A metric that measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances in a dataset.
12. **Model Complexity**: The degree of complexity of a machine learning model, often related to the number of parameters or the capacity to capture intricate patterns in the data.
13. **Overfitting**: A scenario where a machine learning model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data due to capturing noise or irrelevant patterns.
14. **Underfitting**: A scenario where a machine learning model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and testing data.
15. **Linear Regression Model**: A model that predicts a continuous output variable based on the linear relationship between input features and the target variable.
16. **Error/Loss Functions**: Functions that measure the discrepancy between the predicted outputs and the actual values, used to guide the training of a model.
17. **Residuals**: The differences between the observed values and the values predicted by a regression model.
18. **Ordinary Least Squares**: A method for estimating the parameters in a linear regression model by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals.
19. **$R^2$ Measure**: A statistical measure that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
20. **Mean Square Error**: The average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values, used as a measure of model accuracy.
21. **Root Mean Square Error**: The square root of the mean square error, providing an estimate of the standard deviation of the prediction errors.
22. **Cross Validation**: A technique for assessing how a model generalizes to an independent dataset, by partitioning the data and training the model on different subsets.
23. **K-Fold Cross Validation**: A type of cross-validation where the data is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained and tested k times, each time using a different subset as the test set.
24. **Regularized Regression**: A type of regression that includes a penalty for larger coefficients to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
25. **Ridge Regression**: A type of regularized regression that adds a penalty equal to the sum of the squared coefficients to the loss function.
26. **Lasso Regression**: A type of regularized regression that adds a penalty equal to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients to the loss function.
27. **Hyperparameter**: A parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins and controls the behavior of the training algorithm or model.
28. **Class imbalance**: 
29. **Confusion matrix**:
30. **Precision**:
31. **Recall**:
32. **F1-Score**:
33. **Logistic Regression**:
